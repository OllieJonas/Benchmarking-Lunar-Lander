# The Configuration File
In the root directory, there is a config.yml, which allows you to change certain things about it.



I've created a couple tables below organised by section, to make our lives easier

## Overall

Settings that are universal no matter what agent you're running.

| Episodes       | How many episodes to log a detailed report for (ie. output the rest of the things specified below). <br/> <br/> You can pass in either an Integer or List of Integers for this to work. <br/> <br/>Integer: Takes the number, adds one and converts it to a range over the max episodes. <br/> For example: (max_episodes = 1_000, episodes = 5) will save Episodes [0, 200, 400, 600, 800, 999] <br/> <br/>List: Just use that list of integers, capped at the max number of episodes.<br/> For example: (max_episodes = 1_000, episodes = [0, 320, 460, 1625] will save Episodes [0, 320, 460, 999]    | Integer, List[Int] | Can't be less than or equal to 0. <br/> <br/>Cumulative and average rewards are collected at the end of each episode, regardless of this number. This means that these will be saved according to the config options below **regardless** of which episodes you choose to record. <br/> <br/>This will record the actions, rewards, state and a video of the agent for each timestep for this episode. |
