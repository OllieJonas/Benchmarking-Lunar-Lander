           # Creating an Agent

## How

Creating an agent that's recognised by the program is very easy...

1) Create a new .py file under the agents package. Call it whatever you like.
2) Have it implement the AbstractAgent class in abstract_agent.
3) Inherit the methods contained, and call the super constructor, passing action_space into your agent _(kinda messy, maybe should try to change that idk lmao)_

So far, it should look like this:

```python
from rlcw.agents.abstract_agent import AbstractAgent

class YourAgent(AbstractAgent):

    def __init__(self, logger, action_space, cfg):
        super.__init__(logger, action_space, cfg)
        
    def name(self):
        return "YourAgent"
        
    def get_action(self, observation):
        pass
        
    def train(self, training_context):
        pass
```

### Notes
The config passed in here is **not** the global config - it's just the section for this particular agent. So taking
the "random" agent as an example, cfg will look something like this (refer to config.yml for verification):

```python
cfg = {
   "foo": "bar"
}
```

Please feel free to add whatever config options you like - it won't (shouldn't) break anything.

The Logger is there because it avoids some really weird initialisation order stuff - idk what it is but it fixes the problem
and honestly who cares at this point. It is a working logger though, so please feel free to use it.

### Back to Explanation


Here, you can implement those get_action and train methods, based on the information said later on.

4) Go to main.py
5) Import your agent
6) Find the method called `get_agent(name, action_space)`
7) Add the following to it:

```python 
elif name.lower() == "<your_agent>": 
   return YourAgent(logger, action_space, cfg)
```

Bingo bango bongo we're done! 

When starting the application, it looks to the config variable "agent_name" in the config.yml to find the agent to run.
If you want to run your new agent, change the name to whatever you put in (7) to that. 

## Abstract Agent

Abstract Agent is an abstract class to give a template for each new agent that we create - so that our Runner can 
recognise each new agent we create.

### Methods and Constructor Defined

There's only **three** methods defined that will actually NEED to be implemented:
1) `name()`
2) `get_action(observation)`
3) `train(training_context)`

#### name()

`name` is pretty simple - just return the name of the agent here as a string.

#### get_action(observation)

`get_action` is being called at the beginning of the timestep, and will determine what action it takes (well duh.) 

The observation is the thing defined in gym. If you read gym's documentation on it, you'll get more information.

The action space is already defined in the constructor, so you're able to call `self.action_space` to get stuff there.

#### train(training_context)

`train` is being called after the current timestep is greater than the start_training timesteps defined in the 
config.yml.

`training_context` is defined as a list of dict objects, where each dict contains information about each timestep, 
where the index of the list represents that timestep. 

This dict object looks like this:

```python
training_context_item = {
   "curr_state": state,
   "next_state": next_state,
   "reward": reward,
   "action": action
}
```

TODO (Definitely): Make the training_context bounded, and then delete old items. 

_If we need anything else, we can add it later, tbh I'm not really sure what we need right now so I did safe bets?_
