Submission for CM30225 (Reinforcement Learning) at the University of Bath, written by [Fraser Dwyer](https://github.com/Fraser-Dwyer), [Helen Harmer](https://github.com/helen2000), [Ollie Jonas](https://github.com/OllieJonas), and [Yatin Tanna](https://github.com/YatinTanna).

A description of the project (including the config file, creating an agent and the project's structure) can be found in the `docs/` directory.

## Installation Guide

### Console (Linux / Mac)
  
For Linux / Mac, it's very easy to do:

1. Navigate to the root directory for this project
2. Run pip3 install -r requirements.txt
3. Run pip3 install swig
4. Run pip3 install gym[All] or pip3 install gym[Box2D]
5. Set your PYTHONPATH environment variable to rlcw

### Windows

For Windows, you can run this program using Docker.
  
#### Installation Guide (Windows)
  
  1. Install Docker. You can find the link for this here: [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/ "Docker")
  2. For Windows, you're going to need to use WSL 2 Linux Kernel (A Linux Kernel for Windows), and install the Ubuntu distro for WSL. This guide might be helpful:  [Install WS2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-manual). Also note that Docker Desktop _will automatically start when you start your PC._ If you want to disable this, do the following:
      1. Open Task Manager
      2. Go to the Startup Tab
      3. Find Docker Desktop, right click and click Disable.

## Running the Program

For UNIX-based systems, you just need to run the program like any old python program: `python3 -m main`. 
  
For Windows, a `run.bat` file has been included for convenience sake in the root directory. This builds and runs the image, and then collects any results from the container.
